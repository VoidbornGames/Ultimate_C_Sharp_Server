## Features

### 🏗️ Modern Architecture
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Decoupled services for improved maintainability and testability.
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean, modular code with clear separation of concerns.
- **Asynchronous Performance**: Full `async/await` implementation for high concurrency and non-blocking I/O.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: A robust in-memory Event Bus for decoupled, scalable inter-service communication.

### 🔒 Enhanced Security
- **Advanced Password Hashing**: Securely hashes passwords using PBKDF2 with unique salts.
- **Account Lockout Policy**: Automatically locks accounts after multiple failed login attempts.
- **JWT & Refresh Tokens**: Secure, stateless authentication with short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens.
- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Protects against injection attacks and malicious data.
- **Strong Password Policies**: Enforces configurable password complexity requirements.

### 🚀 High-Performance Core
- **In-Memory Caching**: Reduces database/file I/O for frequently accessed data.
- **HTTP Response Compression**: Automatically compresses responses to save bandwidth.
- **Connection Pooling Framework**: Efficiently manages and reuses network connections.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures data is saved and connections close properly on exit.

### 🌐 Web Dashboard
- Modern, responsive dark-themed interface
- Real-time system monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Live server logs viewer with color-coded levels
- Video player with streaming support and progress tracking
- Secure user authentication with JWT tokens
- Mobile-friendly design

### 👥 Advanced User Management
- Secure user registration and login system
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with "remember me" functionality
- Password reset functionality via email token
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) support framework

### 📊 System Monitoring
- Real-time CPU usage tracking
- Memory consumption monitoring
- Disk space usage information

### 🎤 Real-Time Voice Chat
- **Low-Latency UDP**: Built on UDP for real-time communication with minimal delay.
- **High-Quality Audio**: Supports clear 16-bit audio at 16kHz for natural-sounding voice.
- **Room & Channel System**: Organize conversations with dedicated rooms and channels.
- **Targeted Communication**: Voice packets are only forwarded to clients in the same room and channel.
- **Multi-Client Support**: Seamlessly connect multiple clients for group conversations.
- **Robust Client Management**: Automatically handles client connections, room joins, and disconnections.
- **Easy-to-Use Client**: A simple C# client library with room/channel commands for quick integration.

### 🔌 Dynamic Plugin System
- **Hot-Reloading**: Load, update, and unload plugins at runtime without restarting the server.
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Plugins run in isolated contexts for security and stability.
- **Async Lifecycle Hooks**: Plugins can hook into server events with `OnLoadAsync`, `OnUpdateAsync`, and `OnUnloadAsync`.
- **Easy Development**: Simple C# interface-based development model for extending server functionality.

### 📝 Logging System
- Automatic log rotation with ZIP compression
- Real-time log viewing in dashboard
- Multiple log levels (Info, Warning, Error, Security)
- Persistent log storage
